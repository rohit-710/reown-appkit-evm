# Reown: AppKit + EVM Example App

1. Navigate to [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and create a new project. Upon creating a new project, a project ID will be generated. Please copy it, as you will need it to configure your app.
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and paste the project ID generated in Step 1 into the appropriate place.
3. Install all the dependencies required for your app to function properly by running the following command:
    
```bash
npm run dev
```

If you are using alternative package managers, you can try one of these commands: `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev`.
    
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the result.
5. You will now see your example app, which allows you to connect your wallet and use the Scroll network.
