# Reown: AppKit + EVM Example App

1. First, navigate to [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com) and create a new project. Upon creating a new project, a project ID will be generated for the project. Please copy it as you will need it to configure your app.

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and paste the project ID that was generated for you in the previous step (Step 1).

3. Install the necessary dependencies for your app to function properly. So run the command given below:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you are using alternative package managers, you can try either of these commands - `yarn dev`, or `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev`.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. You will be able to see your example app which will allow you to connect your wallet and use the Scroll network.
